# subway-brussels
### Koen Colpaert `@kcolpaert`
__subway_brussels__ is a small analysis exercise on the history of subway stations in Brussels, Belgium. The original idea for this analysis was provided by [Page Piccinini](https://datascienceplus.com/metro-systems-over-time-part-1/) but I changed the source data to map and analyse the Brussels area metro.

This repo contains everything that is needed to replicate the analysis. The main R code can be found in `subway-brussels.r` but I wrote an extensive, verbal log on the analysis process that can be found in `./output/main.Rmd`.

I'm happy to hear your thoughts, ideas, improvements,...
